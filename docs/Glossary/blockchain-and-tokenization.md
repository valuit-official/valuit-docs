# Blockchain & Tokenization
### 1. ERC-20
    - A technical standard for tokens issued on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring compatibility with the broader Ethereum ecosystem.
### 2. ERC-721
    - A standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing for unique, indivisible tokens representing digital or physical assets.
### 3. ERC-3643
    - A token standard on the Ethereum blockchain for compliant security tokens, facilitating regulated asset transactions.
### 4. Security Token
    - A digital token that represents ownership in a regulated financial asset, such as shares in a company, and complies with securities laws.
### 5. Asset-Referenced Token
    - A type of cryptocurrency that is backed by real-world assets, such as commodities or real estate, providing stability and intrinsic value.
### 6. Smart Contract
    - A self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, running on a blockchain.
### 7. Tokenization
    - The process of converting ownership rights to an asset into digital tokens that can be traded on a blockchain.
### 8. Wallet
- A digital tool that allows users to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies or tokens.
### 9. Yield Farming
    - The practice of staking or lending cryptocurrency assets to generate high returns or rewards in the form of additional cryptocurrency.
### 10. Liquidity Pool
    - A collection of funds locked in a smart contract, used to facilitate trading by providing liquidity.
### 11. Proof of Stake (PoS)
    - A consensus mechanism where validators are chosen to create new blocks and validate transactions based on the number of tokens they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral.
### 12. Proof of Work (PoW)
    - A consensus mechanism used by some blockchains where miners compete to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new blocks.
### 13. Layer 1 Blockchain
    - The base layer of a blockchain network that handles all transaction data and consensus. Examples include Bitcoin and Ethereum.
### 14. Layer 2 Blockchain
    - An overlaying network built on top of a Layer 1 blockchain to improve scalability and efficiency, such as the Lightning Network on Bitcoin or Optimism on Ethereum.
### 15. Permissioned Blockchain
    - A blockchain where access to the network is restricted to specific participants, providing controlled and secure environments for business applications.
### 16. Permissionless Blockchain
    - A blockchain where anyone can join and participate without needing approval, ensuring openness and decentralization.
