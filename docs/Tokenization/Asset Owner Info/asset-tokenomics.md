# Asset Tokenomics

## Fundamentals

BlockRidge's tokenomics are structured to provide a robust, transparent, and efficient system for managing tokenized assets. Our tokenomics model is underpinned by several key principles:

### Asset-Backed Tokens

- Each token issued on the BlockRidge platform is backed by a tangible real-world asset, ensuring intrinsic value and stability.
- This includes a variety of asset classes such as real estate, private equity, and revenue-generating businesses.
- Asset-Backed Tokens

### Regulatory Compliance

- Tokens are issued in full compliance with relevant financial regulations, ensuring legal security and investor confidence.
- BlockRidge adheres to standards set by MiCA and other regulatory frameworks, providing a transparent and compliant environment.

### Token Utility

- Tokens serve multiple purposes including investment, liquidity provision, and governance.
- Holders can participate in voting on key decisions, ensuring a democratic and transparent process.

## Asset Token Valuation Mechanism

### Market-Based Valuation:

- Tokens are priced based on real-time market data reflecting current demand and supply.
- BlockRidge integrates advanced analytics to continuously update asset valuations, ensuring market-aligned pricing.

### Income-Based Valuation:

- Valuation based on the income generated by the asset, such as rental income or business revenue.

- Valuation is also derived by comparing similar assets that have been recently sold or tokenized.
- Adjustments are made for differences in asset characteristics and market conditions, leveraging comprehensive market data and analytics.
