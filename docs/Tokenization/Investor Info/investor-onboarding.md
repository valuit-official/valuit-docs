# Investor Onboarding
Valuit's onboarding process is designed to ensure a smooth and efficient integration of liquidity providers onto our platform. We take a comprehensive approach, covering all necessary steps to prepare our partners for successful participation in our ecosystem.

## Onboarding Simplified

Valuit uses an automated onboarding structure for Investors to ensure compliance and efficiency throughout the investment process. In the case of more traditional firms, Valuit offers manual KYC (Know Your Customer) and KYB (Know Your Business) approvals with our compliance team. All information shared during the onboarding process adheres with GDPR regulations to ensure data security and protection.
