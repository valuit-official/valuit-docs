The¬†**$VAL**¬†token is central to the Valuit platform, driving the decentralized finance (DeFi) functions and enabling a seamless experience for asset owners, investors, and stakeholders alike. $VAL is not only a utility token but also a governance tool that empowers holders to shape the Valuit ecosystem, making it a versatile asset that supports a wide range of activities across the platform.

## $VAL Token Overview

The¬†**$VAL**¬†token has several key utilities and features that distinguish it within the tokenized finance market:

1. **Governance**: $VAL holders participate in Valuit‚Äôs decentralized governance, enabling them to propose and vote on key protocol decisions.
2. **Staking Rewards**: By staking $VAL, users can earn rewards and enjoy fee reductions, as well as priority access to oversubscribed assets.
3. **Fee Reduction**: Staking $VAL allows users to benefit from reduced transaction and platform fees.
4. **Ecosystem Currency**: $VAL serves as the primary currency for platform services like asset management, tokenization fees, and more.
5. **Liquidity Pairing**: $VAL is used in liquidity pools for tokenized assets, enhancing liquidity and reducing transaction costs within the platform.

## How $VAL Works: Key Utilities

### 1. Governance and Voting Rights

### 6. Treasury Fund and Buyback Mechanism

A percentage of platform fees and revenue streams fund the DAO-managed treasury, which supports platform development, community initiatives, and strategic growth efforts. This treasury structure allows Valuit to buy back and burn $VAL tokens, directly supporting token value.

- **Revenue-Driven Buyback**: A portion of platform revenue is used to purchase and burn $VAL, reducing circulating supply.
- **DAO-Directed Fund Allocation**: $VAL holders influence fund distribution, ensuring funds align with community interests.
- **Burn Model**: As the platform grows, token supply is reduced, benefiting token holders by increasing scarcity.
