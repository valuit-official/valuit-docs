# Functionality
## $VAL token utilities

### DAO governance function of the Valuit platform

The governance function on the Valuit platform is a cornerstone of its decentralized ecosystem, allowing **$VAL** token holders to shape the platform's development.

**$VAL** token holders propose and vote on key issues such as protocol upgrades, fee structures, and new features. This ensures that decisions are made collectively, reflecting the community's interests.

Voting power will be proportional to the number of tokens held or staked (exact formula will be based on current market conditions), ensuring that those with a greater stake in the platform have more influence over its direction.

**stVAL** tokens will also have a significant role in governance, with a multiplier effect applied to voting power. This means that holders of stVAL tokens will have enhanced influence compared to holders of $VAL tokens, amplifying their voting power during decision-making processes.

Any **$VAL** or **stVAL** token holder will be able to submit proposals. These could range from technical upgrades to new features, community initiatives, or changes in platform policies.

### Treasury Fund

The DAO will control a treasury funded by a portion of platform fees, staking rewards, or other revenue streams. This fund will be used to finance platform development, marketing efforts, partnerships, and other initiatives that benefit the ecosystem. Token holders can submit proposals for how the treasury funds should be spent. Proposals could include hiring developers, funding community projects, or launching marketing campaigns. All expenditures will be transparent and subject to community approval.

### Staking

The Valuit platform offers a comprehensive staking interface, allowing users to stake, manage, and monitor their **$VAL** tokens efficiently. The staking mechanism after Valuit blockchain launch will be a core component of the Valuit blockchain's Proof of Stake consensus, ensuring network security and enabling users to participate in governance and earn rewards.

**Staking Tokens Usage**

Staked **$VAL** tokens in the pool will be used to provide liquidity for trading pairs involving **$VAL** on the platform. This enhances trading efficiency and stability. Apart from APY determined the current market conditions stakers will earn APY based on the profits generated from the trading activities using their staked tokens. APY can be distributed in **$VAL** tokens from the platform's treasury.

**Staking Options for Users**

Lock-Up Periods: Users can stake their **$VAL** tokens for various lock-up periods, such as 30 days, 90 days, or 1 year. Each lock-up period offers different reward rates, allowing users to choose a duration that aligns with their investment strategy and risk appetite. Longer lock-up periods typically offer higher rewards, incentivizing users to commit their tokens for extended periods. Early unstaking will incur a penalty, reducing the overall rewards and potentially a portion of the staked amount, encouraging users to honor their chosen lock-up commitment.

Governance Participation: By staking **$VAL** tokens, users increase their voting power in governance proposals. The more tokens a user stakes, and the longer the staking duration, the greater their influence in governance decisions. This includes voting on platform upgrades, fee structures, and other critical aspects of the Valuit ecosystem. Through this mechanism, staking not only provides financial rewards but also empowers users to shape the future of the platform.

**Staking Benefits for Companies**

Fee Reductions: Companies that stake **$VAL** tokens on the Valuit platform can benefit from reduced fees when tokenizing their products. The more **$VAL** tokens a company stakes, the greater the discount they receive on platform fees, which may include asset tokenization, trading, and other related services. This creates a strong incentive for companies to engage with the staking system, further integrating them into the Valuit ecosystem.

**Staking Utility for Allocation Boost in RWA Launches**

When demand for a new Real-World Asset on the Valuit platform exceeds supply (oversubscription), staking **$VAL** tokens boosts an investor's allocation. The more **$VAL** tokens staked, and the longer the staking duration, the higher the investor's priority and allocation in the new asset.

Priority Allocation: Staked tokens give users priority in oversubscribed RWA launches.

Allocation Multiplier: More tokens and longer staking periods increase allocation.

Tiered System: Users are grouped into tiers based on staked tokens, with higher tiers receiving larger allocations.

**Staking RWA Tokens on Valuit Platform**

The Valuit platform introduces a sophisticated staking mechanism for RWA tokens, incorporating game theory principles to effectively manage staking yields. When holders stake their RWA tokens, they become eligible to receive dividends generated from the asset. Conversely, if holders choose not to stake their tokens, the dividends that would have been accrued will instead be allocated for purchasing tokens from the market, followed by a subsequent token burn.

This mechanism creates a dynamic environment where the yield percentage of dividends is influenced by the overall participation in staking and current market conditions. Specifically, as more users stake their RWA tokens, the yield percentage on dividends decreases. Conversely, when fewer users participate in staking, the yield percentage increases. This incentivizes active participation and aligns the interests of all stakeholders within the Valuit ecosystem.

**After Valuit Protocol Launch:**

Validator Staking: Validators play a critical role in maintaining the security and integrity of the Valuit blockchain. To become a validator, users must stake a minimum amount of **$VAL** tokens. By staking their tokens, validators gain the right to validate transactions on the network and, in return, earn rewards in **$VAL** tokens. The more **$VAL** tokens a validator stakes, the higher their chances of being selected to validate a block, thereby increasing their potential rewards.

Validators who fail to maintain the required level of performance, or who engage in malicious activities, risk losing a portion of their staked tokens through a process known as slashing. This ensures that validators remain committed to the network's security and efficiency.

### stVAL token

stVAL is the staked version of the VAL token in the Valuit ecosystem. Its core functionalities within the ecosystem are as follows:

1. **Aidrops:** Airdrops and incentives in the Valuit ecosystem will be distributed in **stVAL** instead of VAL. This encourages users to keep their tokens staked, reducing immediate sell pressure and promoting long-term participation. By receiving stVAL, users continue to earn rewards while supporting token stability and ecosystem growth.
2. **Anti-Bot Mechanism for Airdrops**: Bots participating in airdrops cannot immediately liquidate stVAL due to slashing penalties associated with unstaking. This deters speculative behavior and market manipulation, fostering a more stable token environment.
3. **Transferability and Liquidity:** **stVAL** can be transferred, traded. Liquidity pools with asset tokens will be created on the platform, allowing users to trade using **stVAL**.
4. **Utility and Value Proposition:** **stVAL** provides users with a clear understanding of the value and yield generated from their staked **VAL** tokens. By holding **stVAL**, users can easily track their staking rewards and potential ROI, reinforcing the benefits of long-term participation in the Valuit ecosystem.
5. **Governance:** Holders of **stVAL** tokens will have the opportunity to participate in the governance of the Valuit ecosystem. By holding **stVAL**, users gain voting rights that allow them to influence key decisions and developments within the project.

### Platform payment

**$VAL** tokens are essential for paying fees on Valuit's marketplace. Companies involved in the tokenization of physical assets—whether it be real estate, different metals, or other real world assets—must use **$VAL** tokens to cover the costs associated with token issuance, asset management. For companies launching new products, **$VAL** tokens are required not only for listing, but also, for various promotional services within the Valuit ecosystem(and on social media). This includes featured listings and marketing campaigns(Twitter, banners on site, Discord).

For companies launching new products, **$VAL** tokens are required not only for listing these new items, but also, for a variety of promotional services within the Valuit ecosystem. This includes but is not limited to featured listings and comprehensive marketing campaigns that aim to increase visibility and attract potential investors and buyers. By using **$VAL** tokens, companies can take advantage of enhanced promotional tools and services that are specifically designed to maximize their market reach and business growth within Valuit's marketplace.

### Transaction fees

**After Valuit Protocol Launch:**

Valuit's blockchain will utilize a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, where the **$VAL** token will serve as the primary utility token within the network. Validators will use **$VAL** tokens to participate in the network's validation process, ensuring the security and proper functioning of the blockchain. In recognition of their efforts, validators will receive compensation in **$VAL** tokens, creating a self-sustaining reward system.

In addition, **$VAL** tokens will be required for users to pay transaction fees across the Valuit network. This includes activities such as token transfers, the execution of smart contracts, and interactions with decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Valuit blockchain. By integrating **$VAL** tokens as the core currency for both validation and transactional operations, the Valuit network ensures a streamlined and efficient ecosystem.

### Buyback and burn

**Platform buyback and burn**: Initially, the buyback and burn mechanism will be funded by a portion of the revenue generated from the platform's activities. This means that as the platform earns revenue through various operations, a percentage of these earnings will be used to purchase VAL tokens from the market and subsequently burn them. This process will help support the token's value and reduce the circulating supply, benefiting the token holders.

**After Valuit Protocol Launch:**

**Blockchain buyback and burn**: Once the Valuit blockchain is fully operational, the buyback and burn mechanism will transition to being funded by a portion of the transaction fees collected on the blockchain. This shift will integrate the mechanism more deeply into the blockchain's infrastructure, ensuring that every transaction on the Valuit blockchain contributes to the reduction of VAL token supply through buybacks and burns.

### Pair token with tokenized assets

The $VAL token will be used as a pairing token in Valuit's liquidity pools, which will focus on tokenized assets. This means users will be able to provide liquidity to pools using $VAL in conjunction with other assets.

One of the key advantages of using the $VAL token is that transaction and swap fees in pools with tokenized assets will be lower compared to pools using other tokens and stablecoins.

**Pools with stVal tokens:** **stVAL** will be utilized in Valuit's liquidity pools with tokenized assets. Users will be able to provide liquidity and trade within these pools using **stVAL** in conjunction with other assets. A significant advantage of using **stVAL** in these pools is that transaction and swap fees will be lower compared to pools using other tokens or stablecoins.uld correspond to the goals and objectives of Valuit and its business model
